				<p class="title">THESIS</p>
				<p class="descript">
					In his novel “The Great Gatsby,” F. Scott Fitzgerald expressed through the introduction of many morally corrupt characters, the suggestion that Gatsby made his fortune illegally, and the association of his wealth with death that Gatsby’s means to achieve his dream ultimately led to his demise; however the depiction of Gatsby as a man of goodness and light reminds us that the dream itself was pure.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="notice">
				<p class="title">ABOUT</p>
				<p class="descript">
					This project was modeled after a choose-your-own-adventure game to illustrate how Gatsby's choices throughout his life both directly and indirectly led to his ultimate demise. Along the way the game reminds the player that Gatsby's intention was only to be reunited with his lover. The game ends the player's journey by eliminating all choices, forcing the player down one path to his/her death to imitate Gatsby's inability to undo his choices.
